Some employees, especially those who write code, have expressed concern about AI replacing them. This quote provides a more accurate estimate of what will happen.

> AI Will Not Replace You, But The Person Using AI Will

AI is proving to be a handy tool in the workplace.  Like any technology, AI has introduced problems such as the generation of misinformation. States are beginning to enact laws and regulations to manage these problems. Despite the issues, it is worth learning how to use AI. &#x20;

In this course, our focus is on problem-solving at home and at work. Creating prompts that yield valuable results takes practice.  Fortunately, as you guide the conversation with an LLM, it will ask you questions that provide cues for further learning.   In this section, we'll focus on using  LLMs to solve problems. &#x20;

### Problem-Solving

Problem-solving, in general, requires a **positive state of mind**.  Usually, a problem arises in a negative context: the basement is flooded, or your child is asking for help with homework that you don't understand.  To successfully work through a problem, you need to think ahead about how nice it will be when it is solved.

#### A Process for Solving Problems

There is no formula for solving all problems, but a set of steps will help you reach a satisfactory solution. These steps can also help you gather the details you need to create a good AI prompt.

1. Define the problem.
2. Collect informational details that pertain to the problem.
3. Draw pictures that connect the details of the problem because visuals can help to see relationships.
4. Brainstorm ideas that could provide a solution.
5. Come up with a list of possible solutions.
6. Rank the possible solutions based on cost, ease of implementation, and prediction of success.
7. Choose the best solution.
8. Test out the solution.
9. If the solution works, you're done. Otherwise, try another solution.
10. Once you are successful, take notes to learn from the process if the problem arises again.

With these steps in mind, let's work through some common problems experienced in daily life.
