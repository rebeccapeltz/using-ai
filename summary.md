# Summary

The content in this eBook, **Using AI at Home and in the Workplace,** is made available to support a course of the same name. This course briefly introduces Artificial Intelligence as it stands in 2024. It is a rapidly evolving field of computing. Both the models and the services or online applications that work with them are changing daily.

Despite the changes, this course provides not only an introduction to the terminology and AI but also how to incorporate what it provides into a problem-solving process. &#x20;

Working with AI calls upon the user to develop prompts that become the basis of a dialog between humans and machinesâ€”the more detailed and specific the prompt, the better the output.  The AI model is completely language-oriented; therefore, a human is most successful when the language used in the prompt is abundant and focused.

Learning is enhanced by activity. This course involves creating prompts and digesting the content returned by the GenAI models. Edublogs is a free online blogging service for education. Students can use these blogs to capture both prompts and responses. Once blogging is mastered, the student can start addressing problems by interacting with different models. The problem resolution experience can be captured in Edublogs.
