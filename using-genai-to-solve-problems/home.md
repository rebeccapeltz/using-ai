The bottom of this page lists common problems encountered at home. The topics range from kids' homework to carpentry. Look at the list and see if any issues strike a chord. We'll work through three items from the list.  After that, you can choose an item not covered here and use one of the LLMs (Gemini, ChatGPT, or Claude.ai) to find a solution.

We'll define each problem, specify related information, choose a model, and create an initial prompt. &#x20;

### Problem 1:  Choosing Paint Colors

#### Problem Definition

My neighbor has asked me to help choose a paint color for the exterior of their house.  We've been neighbors for many years, and I just repainted my house light brown.  I like earthy colors.  My neighbor's house is white, and she wants to use a non-white color.  She also wants her house to fit in with surrounding houses. Our neighbor across the street has an olive green house.

#### Prompt

The problem definition above is almost a complete response.  Notice that I have provided context by describing the neighbor's current color and the colors of other houses around it. Adding a question at the end of the description will make the prompt more specific.&#x20;

Given your preference for earthy colors and the surrounding context, here are some paint color recommendations that would complement both your light brown house and the olive green house across the street:

1. **Warm Taupe** - A soft taupe with warm undertones would harmonize well with the light brown and olive green while providing a subtle yet distinct contrast.
2. **Sage Green** - A muted sage green would blend nicely with the olive green house while offering a softer, more understated look.
3. **Terracotta** - A rich terracotta color can add warmth and earthiness to the neighborhood. It pairs beautifully with both light brown and olive green.
4. **Warm Gray** - A warm gray with brown or green undertones would give the house a modern, neutral look while maintaining an earthy feel.
5. **Deep Beige** - A deeper beige with a hint of warmth would provide a classic, elegant appearance that ties in well with your light brown house and the earthy tones of the surroundings.

These colors should help your neighbor's house fit in beautifully with the neighborhood while still giving it a fresh, new look.
