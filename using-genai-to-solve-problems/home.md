The bottom of this page lists common problems encountered at home. The topics range from kids' homework to carpentry. Look at the list and see if any issues strike a chord. We'll work through three items from the list.  After that, you can choose an item not covered here and use one of the LLMs (Gemini, ChatGPT, or Claude.ai) to find a solution.

We'll define each problem, specify related information, choose a model, and create an initial prompt. &#x20;

### Problem 1:  Choosing Paint Colors

#### Problem Definition

My neighbor has asked me to help choose a paint color for the exterior of their house.  We've been neighbors for many years, and I just repainted my house light brown.  I like earthy colors.  My neighbor's house is white, and she wants to use a non-white color.  She also wants her house to fit in with surrounding houses. Our neighbor across the street has an olive green house.

Given your preference for earthy colors and the surrounding context, here are some paint color recommendations that would complement both your light brown house and the olive green house across the street:

1. **Warm Taupe** - A soft taupe with warm undertones would harmonize well with the light brown and olive green while providing a subtle yet distinct contrast.
2. **Sage Green** - A muted sage green would blend nicely with the olive green house while offering a softer, more understated look.
3. **Terracotta** - A rich terracotta color can add warmth and earthiness to the neighborhood. It pairs beautifully with both light brown and olive green.
4. **Warm Gray** - A warm gray with brown or green undertones would give the house a modern, neutral look while maintaining an earthy feel.
5. **Deep Beige** - A deeper beige with a hint of warmth would provide a classic, elegant appearance that ties in well with your light brown house and the earthy tones of the surroundings.

These colors should help your neighbor's house fit in beautifully with the neighborhood while still giving it a fresh, new look.

### Problem 2:  Kid's Math Homework

#### Problem Definition

I've been working with my middle school daughter to help her with her algebra homework.  She just started the class.  I remember taking algebra when I was her age. I can still solve problems with it, but I don't always know how to explain how to get to the solution.  I need a prompt that identifies my child's grade level, the math problem, and the need for an easy-to-understand explanation.

{% tab title="Prompt" %}
I'm helping my 13-year-old daughter with her algebra homework. What is the answer to this question, and how can I explain how to get it?&#x20;

The problem is: Simplify the expression 4x + 1 -2x - 5
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Gemini Response" %}
### Simplifying the Expression: 4x + 1 - 2x - 5

**Understanding the problem:**

* We're asked to simplify an algebraic expression.
* Simplifying means combining like terms.

**Steps to solve:**

1. **Identify like terms:**
   * Like terms have the same variable raised to the same power.
   * In this case, 4x and -2x are like terms.
2. **Combine like terms:**
   * Add or subtract the coefficients of the like terms.
   * 4x - 2x = 2x
3. **Combine constants:**
   * Constants are numbers without variables.
   * 1 - 5 = -4

**Putting it together:**

* 4x + 1 - 2x - 5 = (4x - 2x) + (1 - 5) = 2x - 4

**Therefore, the simplified expression is 2x - 4.**

**Explanation for your daughter:** Think of it like combining apples and oranges. You can only add or subtract apples with apples and oranges with oranges. In algebra, you can only combine terms with the same variable raised to the same power.

So, we group the terms with x together and the constant terms together. Then, we add or subtract them separately.

### Problem 3: Pest Control

#### Problem Definition

I have gnats in my house, and I can't figure out how to get rid of them. Claude.ai provides me with several options. Notice that at the end of Claude.ai's response, it prompts me to ask if I want more information on any of the suggested options.

I respond to the prompt by asking for more information on one of the options and that becomes Prompt #2.  At the end of the second response, Claude.ai provides me with another prompt of its own, asking if I want even more information.  This is an example of **creating a dialog** with an LLM.

#### Model: Claude.ai

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Prompt" %}
This summer, I've noticed a lot of gnats in the house. I don't know how they're getting in, and they are too small to swat with a fly swatter. What options do I have for ridding our home of gnats?
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Claude.ai Response" %}
Dealing with gnats in your home can be frustrating. Here are several options to help you get rid of them:

1. Identify and remove their breeding sources:
   * Check for overripe fruit or vegetables
   * Look for moist areas in potting soil
   * Inspect drains for organic buildup
2. Use apple cider vinegar traps:
   * Fill a small container with apple cider vinegar
   * Add a few drops of dish soap
   * Cover with plastic wrap and poke small holes
   * Gnats will be attracted and trapped
3. Create a sticky trap:
   * Coat yellow index cards with honey
   * Place them near problem areas
4. Use a vacuum cleaner:
   * Vacuum flying gnats directly from the air
5. Install mesh screens:
   * Check and repair window and door screens
6. Use natural repellents:
   * Place bowls of scented oils like lavender or lemongrass
   * Use citronella candles
7. Maintain a clean environment:
   * Regularly clean drains and garbage disposals
   * Keep your home dry and well-ventilated
8. Consider using insect growth regulators:
   * These disrupt the gnat life cycle without harmful pesticides

If the problem persists after trying these methods, you may want to consult a pest control professional for more targeted solutions.

Would you like more information on any of these methods or additional tips for gnat prevention?
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Prompt #2" %}
Yes, I would like more information on insect growth regulators.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Response #2" %}


Certainly, I'd be happy to provide more information on insect growth regulators (IGRs).

Insect growth regulators are a type of pest control that works differently from traditional insecticides. Instead of killing insects directly, IGRs interfere with their life cycle, preventing them from reaching maturity and reproducing. Here are some key points about IGRs:

1. Mechanism: IGRs typically work by mimicking insect hormones, particularly juvenile hormones. This disrupts the insect's normal development.
2. Effects:
   * Prevent larvae from developing into adults
   * Cause deformities in developing insects
   * Reduce the fertility of adult insects
   * Can make eggs unviable
3. Safety: IGRs are generally considered safer for humans and pets than traditional pesticides because they target specific biological processes in insects.
4. Long-lasting: Many IGRs provide long-term control, often lasting several months.
5. Specific products: For gnats, look for products containing S-Methoprene or Pyriproxyfen. These are common IGRs effective against various flying insects.
6. Application: IGRs often come in liquid form and can be applied using a spray bottle or fogger. Some products are designed to be added to standing water where gnats breed.
7. Combination with other methods: IGRs work well when combined with other control methods, like traps or source reduction.
8. Limitations: IGRs don't kill adult insects, so you might need to combine them with other methods for immediate control.
9. Environmental impact: While generally safer than traditional pesticides, some IGRs can affect non-target insects. Use them judiciously.

When using IGRs, always follow the product instructions carefully. If you're unsure about application or have a severe infestation, consulting a pest control professional might be advisable.

Would you like any more information about using IGRs or other gnat control methods?
