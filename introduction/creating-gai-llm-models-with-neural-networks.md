# Creating GAI/NLP Models with Neural Networks

Chances are you've used a search engine like Google.  You're interested in information about a specific topic, so you type that topic name into the Google search input and wait for Google to return a list of websites that might fulfill your interest.  Although the technology behind this is very different, the user experience for interacting with GAI may feel similar.  You'll provide a request prompt in the form of a question or a command, and after some processing, the GAI model will return content that fulfills your request.  Let's look at how the technology behind this program works.
