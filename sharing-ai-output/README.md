Once you've mastered generating content with AI, you may wonder how best to share it.&#x20;



### How Does AI Text Content Differ from Other Web Page Content

The content you find on web pages all over the internet is not that different from the content published on any web page.  You can copy and paste it anywhere you want to share it.  You could even take credit for it without labeling it as AI-generated content. The big question about sharing GenAI content is to ask what the copyright laws say about it.  As this is a new and rapidly evolving source of information, the copyright laws are not spelled out.  Here's what Gemini says in response to the prompt: **Are there any copyright laws associated with GenAI text content?**

> **Yes, there are copyright laws associated with GenAI text content.**
>
> While artificial intelligence (AI) can generate text, the copyright status of that content is complex and often depends on several factors:
>
> 1. **Originality:** If the AI-generated text is sufficiently original and creative, it may be eligible for copyright protection. This means that the AI itself does not hold the copyright, but the person who owns the AI or commissioned the content might.
> 2. **Human input:** The amount of human involvement in the creation process can influence copyright. If a human significantly contributes to the text's originality, they may be considered the author and hold the copyright.
> 3. **Existing copyright:** If the AI is trained on copyrighted material, the AI-generated text may incorporate elements of that material. This could raise copyright infringement concerns.
> 4. **Terms of service:** The terms of service for the AI platform you're using will likely address copyright issues. Some platforms may claim ownership of the generated content or grant you certain rights.
>
> **It's important to consult with a legal professional** to understand the specific copyright implications of AI-generated text in your particular situation.

Whether or not GenAI content is copyrighted depends on the model, the service or application you used to prompt, and the prompt itself. &#x20;

* <mark style="background-color:red;">If the output uses a lot of language and ideas expressed in the prompt, the individual creating the prompt could copyright the content.</mark>
* <mark style="background-color:red;">If the AI model is trained on copyrighted material, copyright infringement is possible.</mark>
* <mark style="background-color:red;">A Terms of Service should be associated with the application or service you're submitting prompts from, which may describe copyright protection.</mark>

#### Paraphrasing

Please take a minute to look at the output from the Gemini prompt and the explanation of copyright protection highlighted in red below it.  The text below the AI-generated content is a rewording of the original content.  Rewording content like this doesn't always prevent it from violating copyright protection, but if you take the time to reword it, you will understand it better yourself.  You may remember teachers admonishing you to _"Put it in your own words"._  Paraphrasing is an excellent way to test your understanding of what you've read.  In case you were wondering, several AI-driven services online will paraphrase for you, but that defeats the purpose of this discussion.

Sometimes, it makes sense to share GenAI content directly, such as when you've created a prompt with details and specific output, such as for the Product to Market example in Solving Problems for [Work](../using-genai-to-solve-problems/work.md).  Generally, it's a good idea to consider citing the origin of shared GenAI content.  Traditional style guides like MLA and APA can help with this.
