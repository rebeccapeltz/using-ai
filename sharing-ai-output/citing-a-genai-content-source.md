### Style Guides

Style guides like [MLA (Modern Language Association)](https://www.mla.org/) and [APA (American Psychological Association)](https://www.apa.org/) help students and researchers format their work and give credit for others' work.  No law in place says you must apply these style guide citation formats when sharing GenAI content, but it is helpful to know that they exist and are evolving in the same way that GenAI is evolving.

#### APA Citation

The [APA Citation for GenAI](https://apastyle.apa.org/blog/how-to-cite-chatgpt) content is similar to the citation used for personal communication.  Since there is no public link to the content you generated in a session with AI, the citation is just enough information to learn when, where, and from whom you got the information.

The format for a ChatGPT citation looks like this:

OpenAI. (Year). _ChatGPT_ (Version) \[Large language model] [https://chatgpt.com/](https://chatgpt.com/)

A more general version looks like this:

(Company/Owner) (Year) (Model) (Model Version)(Model type)(web link to service)

#### MLA Citation

The [MLA Citation for GenAI](https://style.mla.org/citing-generative-ai/) content is similar to the APA citation.  The MLA considers GenAI content to be personal communication.

The format for a ChatGPT citation looks like this:

"My prompt" _ChatGPT_, 13 Feb. version, OpenAI, 8 Mar. 2023, [https://chatgpt.com/](https://chatgpt.com/)

(Prompt) (Model) (Model version), (Company/Owner), (Prompt Date), (web link to service)
